# Introduction

After eDNA is collected, it's processed in the lab and analyzed through a series of molecular and computational steps. This section introduces the full pipeline from extraction to ecological insight.

---

# DNA Extraction

## Methods
- Commercial kits (e.g., Qiagen, Zymo)
- CTAB protocol (especially for difficult substrates)
- Mechanical lysis (bead beating) for tough samples

## Museum Considerations
- Ethanol extracts may require extra clean-up
- Small sample volumes and degraded DNA need gentle handling

---

# PCR Amplification

## Key Components
- Target gene (COI, 16S, 18S, ITS)
- Forward and reverse primers with sample-specific barcodes
- Polymerase mix, buffers, thermal cycler

## Multiplexing
- Add indexes (barcodes) to each sample
- Allows pooling of hundreds of samples for sequencing

---

# Library Preparation & Sequencing

## Platforms
- **Illumina MiSeq**: Short reads, high accuracy, widely used
- **Oxford Nanopore**: Long reads, portable, real-time
- **PacBio**: Long, accurate reads (more expensive)

## Library Steps
- Clean and quantify PCR products
- Pool amplicons
- Add adapters for platform-specific sequencing

---

# Bioinformatics Workflow

## Quality Control
- Trim adapters, remove low-quality reads
- Filter out chimeras (artifacts)

## Sequence Inference
- Denoising tools (e.g., DADA2, UNOISE)
- Generate ASV table (amplicon sequence variants)

## Taxonomic Assignment
- Compare ASVs to reference databases (SILVA, MIDORI, BOLD)
- Use BLAST, RDP classifier, or QIIME’s built-in classifiers

---

# Diversity and Community Analysis

## Alpha Diversity
- Measures richness within a sample
- Shannon, Simpson, Observed ASVs

## Beta Diversity
- Compares composition between samples
- Dissimilarity indices (Bray-Curtis, Jaccard)
- Ordination techniques (NMDS, PCA, PCoA)

---

# Visualization and Interpretation

## Common Tools
- `phyloseq` in R
- Bar plots, heatmaps, diversity plots
- Network analysis for co-occurrence

## Museum Applications
- Archive eDNA extracts with specimen metadata
- Link modern and historical biodiversity
- Contribute to public reference libraries (e.g., GenBank, BOLD)

---

# Challenges and Caveats

- **False positives/negatives** from contamination or low biomass
- **Transport effects**: DNA from upstream or other locations
- **PCR bias**: Not all taxa amplify equally

---

# Preservation and DNA Recovery: Formalin and Ethanol

## Why this matters:
- Many museum collections contain valuable specimens preserved decades ago.
- Modern methods like eDNA offer a chance to **recover biodiversity signals** from these specimens.
- Success depends on how the material was stored and preserved.

## DNA from Ethanol
- DNA can leach into ethanol from tissue over time.
- Ethanol can be extracted directly and filtered like a water sample.
- Be aware of:
  - Evaporation
  - Microbial contamination
  - Loss of long DNA fragments

## DNA from Formalin
- Formalin causes **extensive crosslinking**, degrading DNA quality.
- Extraction success depends on:
  - Sample age
  - Buffering (neutral-buffered formalin is better)
  - Use of reversal techniques (e.g., heat, alkaline lysis, long incubation)

## Tips for Success
- Use high-sensitivity kits or protocols for low-input DNA
- Consider using **PCR-free** library prep if DNA is heavily damaged
- Focus on short amplicons (100–200 bp) for degraded samples

# Final Thoughts

eDNA analysis is a powerful tool, but it requires rigorous protocols and thoughtful interpretation. Used well, it offers scalable, reproducible insights across fields—from conservation to curation.
