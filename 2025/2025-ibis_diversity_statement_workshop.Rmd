What is a Diversity Statement?
</font>

- Also known as a Perspectives or Experience Statement
- One of three statements in an application package
- Least clear and most misunderstood piece of the package

## {.flexbox .vcenter}
Timeline | Inception of the Diversity Statement

- Early 2000s in the UC system
- Early 2010s Widely adopted by universities for faculty positions
- Mid 2010s Called into question by creating the false dichotomy of DEI v Merit- based hiring
- 2018 UC system made the statements mandatory for tenure-track position applications

## {.flexbox .vcenter}
Timeline | Current State of the Statement

- 2020 Near complete adoption of the practice **allegedly** in response to the murder of George Floyd
- 2022 UW rejected making the statement a requirement for tenure-track applications
- 2023 Banned in public institutions in Texas, North Carolina and Missouri
- 2025 it is often a requirement in non-tenure track applications, often optional

## {.flexbox .vcenter}
Purpose

- Academic search committees can gauge a candidate's 'fit' with the institution/ student body
- Documentation method to include the unpaid labor and often overlooked work of non-majority candidates

## {.flexbox .vcenter .bigger}
<font size="12">
So, *what* is it actually?
</font>

## {.flexbox .vcenter}
It is

- Fundamental demonstration of your values, commitments and capabilities in an academic position
- Three areas of demonstration - the core of the academic position
  - Research
  - Teaching
  - Service
- Another opportunity to stand out

## {.flexbox .vcenter .bigger}
<font size="12">
What it is *not*
</font>

## {.flexbox .vcenter}
It is not

- About you 
  - Your identities 
  - Your privileges 
- Not a chance to medal in the Oppression Olympics
- Not a savior narrative, nor a
  - Pie in the Sky
  - We are the World
  - Ideological pontification

## {.flexbox .vcenter}
How does it fit in your application package?

  - Philosophy in practice
  - Qualifications
  - Future contributions 
- Research Statement highlights your
  - Direction and purpose of scientific inquiry

Things to Keep in Mind
</font>

## {.flexbox .vcenter}
Pitfalls to Avoid

- Over-sharing your personal story
- Over-sanitizing your statement is a red flag 
- Self depreciation due to your privilege *or* 
- Trauma dumping to prove you've 'earned it'

## {.flexbox .vcenter}
Pitfalls to Avoid

- False equivalencies - hyperbole and rhetoric are not useful tools here
- Lack of specificity - theory is just an unpracticed thought in this regard
- Trying to make a dollar out of 15 cents - don't oversell or inflate your experiences

## {.flexbox .vcenter}
Tips for Writing & Editing

- Remember: “Diversity statements are fundamentally about your values, commitments, and capabilities, and the ways it shapes your work.”
- Limited experience does not make you a terrible educator, just a new one.
  - Demonstrate what you’ve learned and how you can implement it. 
  - Don't let your beliefs around the *facts* to supersede the facts themselves
- Writing a positionality statement first 

## {.flexbox .vcenter} 
Tips for Writing & Editing

- Storyboarding or concept mapping your package makes this easier to visualize
- Updating your CV before beginning
- Tailor it to the institution and position
- Don't waste space repeating yourself
- Get another set of eyes on that joint!

Wrapping it up
</font>

## {.flexbox .vcenter}
Reminders

- Remember, it is not who you are, but what you can do
- Specificity, specificity, specificity!
- Connect this statement to your teaching and research statements for maximum impact
