# Welcome!

- Grounding, taking 2 seconds to get everyone to change gears into our space & possibly a land acknowledgement

## About Me | 
- three points of interest/ alignment with the reason I'm giving the presentation

## About You

# What is a Diversity Statement? (this is where I'll ask about what folks know or don't)

- Also known as a Perspectives or Experience Statement
- One of three statements in an application package
- Least clear and most misunderstood piece of the package

## Timeline
- Around since early 2000s in the UC system
- Widely adopted in early 2010s by universities for faculty positions
- Called into question in mid-2010s by creating the false dichotomy of DEI v Merit- based hiring
- UC system made the statements mandatory in 2018 for tenure-track position applications
- 2020 saw an almost absolute adoption of the practice in response to the murder of George Floyd and the inception of the nationwide Black Lives Matter movement
- 2022 UW rejected making the statement a requirement for tenure-track applications
- Banned in public institutions in Texas, North Carolina and Missouri in 2023 (because it isn't a 'merit-based' metric)
- 2025 it is often a requirement in non-tenure track applications, often optional

## Purpose
- Academic search committees can gauge a candidate's 'fit' with the institution/ student body
- Documentation method to include the unpaid labor and often overlooked work of non-majority candidates

## How does it fit in your application package?
- Recap teaching statement purpose
- Recap research statement purpose
- Bow on the package


# Why write one?

- Perfect opportunity to align your MVV with the institution
- Chance to expand on what you’ve already written in your teaching & research statements
- Demonstrates your understanding of ‘DEI’ beyond visible diversity
- How to thematically present yourself as a candidate by weaving your narrative across all 3 statements
